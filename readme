This is a **Discord bot** built using **discord.js** that provides essential server management features, including member greetings, custom welcome messages, and more.

## Features
- **Custom Welcome Messages**: Greets new users with a personalized welcome message, using their Discord nickname or username.
- **Moderation Tools**: Manages users, bans, kicks, and more (add future features here).
- **Bot Presence**: Allows the bot to set its status to "Do Not Disturb" or other customizable statuses.

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your bot's token:

   ```

## Usage
